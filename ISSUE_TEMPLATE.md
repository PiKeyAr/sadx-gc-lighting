  If you are submitting an enhancement request, you may safely ignore this.
  If you are submitting a bug report, READ BELOW:

  --- Is it actually a bug in this mod? ---

  Before reporting the bug, follow these steps and ensure that the bug still occurs:

  - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MOD. Even better, test the latest
    development version, either by building the code yourself or by downloading the
    latest build from the build bot.

  - UPDATE YOUR MOD LOADER TO THE LATEST VERSION, open the Mod Manager, and click `Yes`
    when prompted to update the installed mod loader DLL. Once completed, try to reproduce
    the bug again.

  - DISABLE ALL CODES in the Codes tab of the Mod Manager and try again.

  - DISABLE ALL OTHER MODS, then try to trigger the bug again.
    (Mods that are completely utilitarian are the exception to this rule, such as 
    https://github.com/SonicFreak94/sadx-input-mod)

  If you are unable to reproduce the bug under these conditions, it either isn't caused by
  this mod, or is due to a conflict with another mod. In the case of a conflict, see below.

  --- Does it only happen in combination with other mods? ---

  To determine whether or not the bug is caused by another mod, or is due to a conflict with
  another mod, follow these steps:

  - DISABLE ONLY sadx-gc-lighting AND TRY AGAIN. If the bug persists, it is not an issue
    with sadx-gc-lighting and should be reported to the author of those mods through 
    appropriate channels.

  - Enable sadx-gc-lighting and one other mod, and try again. Add and test one additional mod
    at a time until the issue can be reproduced.

  If the bug cannot be reproduced under these conditions, it is UNLIKELY that sadx-gc-lighting
  is the cause.

  If this is not applicable (like for example, if Emerald Coast always loads the wrong palette),
  just go ahead and delete this whole section.
